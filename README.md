# Tasks Minimap
KDE Plasma taskbar that arranges task items based on window positions.

Created for use with [Karousel](https://github.com/peterfajdiga/karousel), but because it just dumbly reads windows positions,
it is not ideal for this use case, as it doesn't correctly arrange maximized windows, fullscreen windows, and stacked columns.

Ideally there would be some sort of communication between Karousel and the Plasmoid, allowing for accurate task item arrangement
and mouse dragging support. But that would make for a completely different plasmoid, so I'm archiving this one.
